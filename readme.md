This is an older project of mine from earlier in my coding career. I don't feel like making it private or deleting it, but this project does not necessarily reflect my current methodology as a developer. No further changes have been made. 

`ruby simulate.rb 100 10`

returns a random number between 1 and 100 by performing an algorithm on one or more random inputs 1 through 10. 

Add `-v` as a third argument to see which process is being done, and at what efficiency.
